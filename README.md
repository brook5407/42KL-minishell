## üí° About

> _This project is about creating a simple shell. Yes, your own little bash. You will learn a lot about processes and file descriptors.._

## üöÄ Content

### üö© Mandatory part

Write a shell

- Display a prompt when waiting for a new command.
- Have a working history.
- Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a relative or an absolute path).
- Not use more than one global variable. Think about it. You will have to explain its purpose.
- Not interpret unclosed quotes or special characters which are not required by the subject such as \ (backslash) or ; (semicolon).
- Handle ‚Äô (single quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the meta- characters in the quoted sequence.
- Handle " (double quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the meta- characters in the quoted sequence except for $ (dollar sign).
- Implement redirections:
- < should redirect input.
- *>* should redirect output.
- << should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the delimiter is seen. However, it doesn‚Äôt have to update the history!
- *>>* should redirect output in append mode.
- Implement pipes (| character). The output of each command in the pipeline is connected to the input of the next command via a pipe.
- Handle environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters) which should expand to their values.
- Handle $? which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.
- Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash.
- In interactive mode:
- ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line. ‚ó¶ ctrl-D exits the shell.
- ctrl-\ does nothing.
- Your shell must implement the following builtins:
- echo with option -n
- cd with only a relative or absolute path ‚ó¶ pwd with no options
- export with no options
- unset with no options
- env with no options or arguments
- exit with no options

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Requirements

The function is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling the program**

To compile, go to the program path and run:

```shell
$ make
```
**2. Executing the program**

To execute the program, run:

```C
$ ./minishell
```
***Makefile rules***

- `make` -- compiles philo.
- `make clean` -- deletes object files.
- `make fclean` -- deletes object files and philo.
- `make re` -- `fclean` + `make`.
- `make norm` -- check norminette
